# IPTV Desktop Application Design

This project presents the design of a modern IPTV desktop application.  
Since most existing IPTV designs look outdated, I wanted to create something fresh and contemporary â€” inspired by platforms like **Netflix** and **Prime Video**.

The project includes three main screens:

1. **Home Page** â€“ displays trending content, the most watched shows and films, and live TV channels from different countries.  
2. **Live TV** â€“ showcases various categories (such as countries and genres) where users can browse and select programs.  
3. **Movies** â€“ provides a list of available movies along with short descriptions.
